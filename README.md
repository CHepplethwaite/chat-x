Chat-X ü§ñ (RAG with Django, DRF, OpenAI & LangChain)

Chat-X is an ongoing Django project that uses OpenAI and LangChain to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot.

It consists of:

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) serving APIs

Frontend: Angular SPA (fe/ folder) for interacting with the chatbot

In simple terms:
This chatbot can read documents, remember them, and answer questions using AI with context from your data ‚Äî served through a web frontend.

‚ú® Features (planned)

Upload documents (PDFs, text, etc.)

Store document knowledge in a vector database

Ask natural language questions through a chat page

Get AI answers grounded in your documents (not just guesses)

Frontend consumes DRF APIs for chat, user management, and document handling

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Backend:

Python 3.9+

Django 5.2+

Django REST Framework

LangChain

OpenAI account & API key

Git

Frontend:

Node.js 18+

npm or Yarn

Angular CLI

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/CHepplethwaite/chat-x.git
cd chat-x

2. Backend Setup (Django + DRF)
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Add your OpenAI key:
Create a .env file in the project root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here


Apply migrations and run the server:

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver


Backend API base URL will be available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/

3. Frontend Setup (Angular SPA)
cd fe
npm install
ng serve


Frontend runs at:

http://localhost:4200


Update API URLs in src/environments/environment.ts to point to Django DRF endpoints.

üí¨ Testing the Chatbot

Currently, you can test the chatbot by asking questions:

"What does the document say about climate change?"


The workflow:

Search document knowledge via DRF API

Pick relevant text

Generate AI answer with OpenAI via LangChain
